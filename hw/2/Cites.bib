abstract="This paper develops a theory of quantum automata and their slightly more general versions, q-automata. Quantum languages and $\eta$-quantum languages, 0≤$\eta$<1, are studied. Functions that can be realized as probability maps for q-automata are characterized. Quantum grammars are discussed and it is shown that quantum languages are precisely those languages that are induced by a quantum grammar. A quantum pumping lemma is employed to show that there are regular languages that are not $\eta$-quantum, 0≤$\eta$<1.",
